### Please write the problem statement of your project.

I want to be able to play a simple, entertaining 2-player game on my computer with someone else.

### Mention the four user stories that your team has decided to work on.

 1. As a user, I want to be able to see the rules of the game clearly.
 2. As a user, I want to be able to see my score/statistics clearly.
 3. As a user, I want to be able to select a character.
 4. As a user, I want to be able to attack and callibrate.

### Design a wireframe for your project.

**Note** 

* You are free to draw it on paper or use any computer application such as Balsamic.
* Please create a seperate folder for this question. Name the folder 'wireframe' and then upload the file inside that folder.
